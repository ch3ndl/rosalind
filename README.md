# Rosalind Bioinformatics Solutions

This repository contains Python solutions to bioinformatics problems from Rosalind (http://rosalind.info/). For some problems, simple shell scripts or one-liner commands are also provided as alternative solutions.

## Structure

- Each problem is solved in a separate Python script named after the problem ID (e.g., `dna.py` for the "Counting DNA Nucleotides" problem).
- Shell scripts or commands, if applicable, are included in the same directory as the Python solution.

## Usage

To run a Python solution:

```bash
python3 <problem_id>.py
